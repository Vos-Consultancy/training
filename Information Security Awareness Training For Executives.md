# Information Security Awareness Training For Executives

**1 day, 4 hours**

## Introduction

This information security awareness session is specially designed for executive management, CEOs, and boards of directors. It engages them in a business context to help explain the threats and risks from cyber-attacks involving information disclosure and data theft, and provides simple tactical and strategic steps to improve organisational resilience to reputation-damaging cyber crises.

A cyber-crisis is often invisible and nearly impossible to detect in its early stages. The data has been stolen, the media knows about the attack, and your customers are worried about their personal data being in the hands of criminals. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) theft or disclosure through improper handling or storage can result in hefty fines and possible jail time.
