# Safeguarding Critical Software Supply Chain Data Through Effective Risk Assessment

## 1. What is a Risk Assessment?

A **risk assessment** is a structured process to identify, evaluate, and prioritize risks that could affect an organization’s objectives—especially in the context of protecting critical software supply chain data. It helps determine:

- **What can go wrong** (threats and vulnerabilities)  
- **What the impact would be**  
- **How likely it is to happen**  
- **How to respond** (mitigation or acceptance)

In the software supply chain, this includes risks related to third-party code, development environments, version control systems, CI/CD pipelines, and distribution methods.

## 2. What Should Be Included in a Risk Assessment?

### a. Scope Definition
Define what is in scope, including systems, processes, and third-party services.

### b. Asset Identification
List critical assets such as source code, CI/CD infrastructure, and dependency libraries.

### c. Threat Identification
Identify potential threats like:
- Malicious code in open-source dependencies
- Stolen developer credentials
- Insider misuse or error

### d. Vulnerability Assessment
Assess known weaknesses, e.g.:
- Lack of code review
- Insecure scripts in the build process
- No vetting of third-party packages

### e. Risk Analysis
Evaluate the **likelihood** and **impact** of each threat scenario.

### f. Risk Evaluation
Decide which risks are acceptable and which need mitigation.

### g. Mitigation Measures
Examples include:
- Access control and MFA
- Secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) practices
- Dependency scanning and software bill of materials (SBOM)

### h. Documentation
Document the risk assessment process, findings, and decisions.

### i. Review and Update Cycle
Risk assessments should be periodically updated, especially when systems, vendors, or threats change.

## 3. Who Can File a Risk?

**Short answer:** Anyone in the company—even the cleaning staff.

Encouraging a **risk-aware culture** means everyone, regardless of role or technical expertise, should feel empowered to report anything unusual or potentially risky. For example:

- A cleaner noticing an unattended unlocked laptop  
- An intern spotting suspicious files in a repository  
- A developer observing unusual CI/CD behavior

This democratized approach to risk reporting helps detect early warning signs before they escalate.

## 4. How to Follow Up on a Risk and Close It

Once a risk has been reported and assessed, it needs to be managed to resolution. The follow-up and closure process typically includes:

### a. Assign Ownership
- Appoint a responsible person or team to handle the risk.
- Ensure they have the authority and resources to act.

### b. Track Mitigation Progress
- Define clear mitigation actions (e.g. patching, vendor review, policy update).
- Set timelines and milestones.
- Monitor progress through regular status updates.

### c. Reassess Residual Risk
- After mitigation, reassess the risk level.
- Determine if the residual risk is acceptable based on your risk appetite.

### d. Validate and Document Closure
- Confirm that mitigation actions were fully implemented and effective.
- Document the entire lifecycle: detection, evaluation, action taken, and closure justification.

### e. Communicate and Share Lessons Learned
- Inform relevant stakeholders of the outcome.
- Update procedures or training if the risk revealed gaps in process or awareness.

### f. Archive the Record
- Keep records for audit, compliance, and future reference.

> Remember: A closed risk should be *reviewable*, *traceable*, and *justified*.
