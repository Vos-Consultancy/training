### Slide 1: What is Information?

Information is anything of value to your organization:

* Intellectual property (e.g., engineering designs)  
* Business contacts (internal or external)  
* Access credentials (keys, access cards, passwords, cryptographic keys)  

**Why it matters**:  
Loss of sensitive information can disrupt operations, cause reputational damage, and lead to legal exposure.  
Unlike physical theft, data breaches often go unnoticed.

**Your role**:  
* Identify sensitive information your team handles  
* Ensure appropriate protection measures  
* Promote awareness among team members
